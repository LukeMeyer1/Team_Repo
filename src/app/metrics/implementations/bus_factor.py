    Evaluates contributor redundancy and maintainer health.
    
    Bus factor measures project sustainability risk by assessing:
    - Number of active contributors and their contribution distribution
    - Recent commit activity patterns and consistency
    - Maintainer responsiveness to issues and pull requests
    - Organizational vs individual project ownership
    - Community engagement and external contributions
    
    Future Implementation Notes:
    - Query GitHub API for comprehensive contributor statistics
    - Analyze commit patterns, frequency, and author diversity over time
    - Check issue response times, PR merge rates, and community engagement
    - Evaluate organizational backing vs individual maintainer dependency
    - Consider Hugging Face organization memberships and verified accounts
    - Assess project governance and decision-making structure
    
    Scoring Rubric (Future):
    - 1.0: Multiple active maintainers, strong organizational backing
    - 0.8: Several contributors, good activity, some organizational support
    - 0.6: Few active contributors but consistent maintenance
    - 0.4: Limited contributors, irregular maintenance activity
    - 0.2: Single maintainer or very infrequent updates
    - 0.0: Abandoned project or no visible maintenance
