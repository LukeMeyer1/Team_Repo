    Evaluates presence and quality of linked dataset and code documentation.
    
    This composite metric assesses the completeness of the model ecosystem by analyzing:
    - Availability and accessibility of training/evaluation datasets
    - Quality and completeness of dataset documentation
    - Presence of associated code repositories
    - Code quality and maintainability indicators
    - Integration between model, data, and code components
    
    Future Implementation Notes:
    - Check Hugging Face model cards for dataset references
    - Validate dataset accessibility and download success
    - Analyze dataset documentation completeness and metadata quality
    - Evaluate associated code repositories for completeness
    - Assess integration quality between model/dataset/code components
