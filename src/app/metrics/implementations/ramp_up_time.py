    Evaluates ease of adoption from documentation quality.
    
    This metric assesses how quickly developers can start using a model by evaluating:
    - README completeness and clarity
    - Usage examples and code snippets  
    - API documentation quality
    - Model card information completeness
    - Quick-start guides and tutorials
    - Installation/setup instructions
    
    Future Implementation Notes:
    - Fetch and analyze README.md structure and content depth
    - Parse and validate code examples for syntax correctness
    - Evaluate Hugging Face model card completeness score
    - Assess documentation readability using Flesch-Kincaid metrics
    - Check for step-by-step tutorials and getting-started guides
    - Verify links and references are working and up-to-date
    
    Scoring Rubric (Future):
    - 1.0: Comprehensive docs with working examples and clear tutorials
    - 0.8: Good documentation with minor gaps in examples or setup
    - 0.6: Basic documentation present but missing key information
    - 0.4: Minimal documentation, unclear setup instructions
    - 0.2: Very limited documentation, difficult to get started
    - 0.0: No meaningful documentation or examples
