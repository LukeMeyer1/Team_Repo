    Evaluates code style, testing, and maintainability of associated repositories.
    
    This metric assesses software engineering quality by analyzing:
    - Code style consistency and adherence to standards
    - Test coverage and testing methodology quality
    - Code organization and architectural quality
    - Documentation coverage (docstrings, comments, API docs)
    - Dependency management and security practices
    - CI/CD pipeline presence and quality
    
    Future Implementation Notes:
    - Analyze code repositories via GitHub API for structure and metrics
    - Run static analysis tools (pylint, flake8, bandit) on code samples
    - Evaluate test coverage reports and testing framework usage
    - Check for continuous integration and automated testing
    - Assess documentation coverage and API documentation quality
    - Analyze dependency management (requirements.txt, setup.py, etc.)
    
    Scoring Rubric (Future):
    - 1.0: Excellent code quality with comprehensive testing and documentation
    - 0.8: Good practices with minor gaps in testing or documentation
    - 0.6: Acceptable quality but missing some best practices
    - 0.4: Poor organization or limited testing coverage
    - 0.2: Very poor code quality with significant issues
    - 0.0: No code available or completely unmaintainable
