    Evaluates dataset reliability, popularity, and quality indicators.
    
    This metric focuses specifically on the datasets used for training and evaluation:
    - Dataset size, diversity, and representativeness
    - Data quality indicators (completeness, accuracy, consistency)
    - Dataset popularity and community adoption
    - Citation count and academic recognition
    - Data collection methodology and ethics
    - Bias analysis and fairness considerations
    
    Future Implementation Notes:
    - Analyze dataset statistics from Hugging Face datasets hub
    - Cross-reference with academic papers and citation counts
    - Evaluate dataset documentation and metadata completeness
    - Check for bias analysis and ethical considerations
    - Assess dataset maintenance and update frequency
